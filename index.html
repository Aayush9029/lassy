          When I first looked at       <div class="red">Lassy</div>
           it looked like a hybrid between a
          legendary creature THE UNICORN and our favorite karate champion zebra
          (get it cause it has a lot of black belts) *Iâ€™ll stop*, Anyhow while
          doing some research on zebras *and unicorns* I found they looked
          adorable and I kinda wanted to pet them but it was not possible
          because of social distancing of-course, and the fact that unicorns
          live in Rainbow Land which is a bit far from where I live. So I
          thought of making a game where one can pet <div class="red">Lassy</div> but the catch is
          <div class="red">Lassy</div> likes to break the matrix and run offscreen, can you help me pet
          <div class="red">Lassy</div> before it leaves the screen?, also <div class="red">Lassy</div> knows shadow clone jitsu
          so you have to catch em all. Good luck.
